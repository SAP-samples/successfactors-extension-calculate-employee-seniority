## Clone the GitHub repository and adapt the configuration

This mission enhances the use case covered in [Calculate Employee Seniority with event-driven extensions](https://github.com/SAP-samples/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority/tree/mission)

You don't have to follow the entire mission, but at minimum you need to ensure the right pre-requisite SAP BTP services are provisioned in your subaccount. You can add the entitlements by following the instructions on the [mission GitHub repo](https://github.com/SAP-samples/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority/tree/mission/01-SetupSAPBusinessTechnologyPlatform)

The remaining steps are similar to the ones covered in the main mission branch, namely:

1. Go to <https://github.com/SAP-samples/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority/tree/sfsf-mobile-appgyver> and fork the repository so that you have the source code and can further on work and change the code. (For instance, in one of the subsequent steps you can customize the business rules to your own requirements)

    ![Fork Repo](./images/fork-repo.png)
  
2. Choose your user as destination for the fork. 

    <img src="./images/fork-repo-user.png" alt="Choose user for fork" width="250">

    You should now have the following repository: https://github.com/**YourUser**/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority 

3.	Choose *Terminal -> New Terminal* in the menu on the top of your screen.

    ![Open Terminal](./images/dev-cap-app-5.png)
 
4. In the opened terminal go to projects folder with executing
   
   ``` 
   cd projects
   ``` 

5. Clone your forked sample GitHub repository for this mission. 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/YourUser/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority
    ```

    > IMPORTANT: Replace **YourUser** with your actual username. 

6. Checkout the ```sfsf-mobile-appgyver ``` branch
   
     ```
    git checkout sfsf-mobile-appgyver
    ```

7.	Click on *File* in the menu on the top and choose *Open Workspace* in the drop down.

    ![Open Workspace](./images/dev-cap-app-7.png)
 
8.	Open the project by selecting projects -> successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority and click on *Open*

9. After the project has been cloned and opened successfully, you need to adapt the configuration of the project to your environment. For this, you have to enter the name of the registered SAP SuccessFactors System from the step [Setup SAP BTP and SAP SuccessFactors connectivity and extensibility](https://github.com/SAP-samples/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority/tree/mission/02-SetupSAPBTPAndSAPSuccessFactorsConnectivityAndExtensibility) (in this case *mySF*) into two files:

*mta.yaml*:
  ```yaml
    ...
    - name: seniority-calc-sfsf-service
      #type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
      type: org.cloudfoundry.existing-service
      parameters:
        service: sap-successfactors-extensibility
        service-plan: api-access
        config:
          systemName: <NAME-OF-REGISTERED-SFSF-SYSTEM>
          technicalUser: sfadmin
  ```

*em.json*:
  ```json
  {
    "emname": "seniority_calculator",
    "namespace": "sap/successfactors/<NAME-OF-REGISTERED-SFSF-SYSTEM>",
    "options": {
      "management": true,
    ...
  ```

10. Change the [payload URI](https://github.com/SAP-samples/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority/blob/main/srv/emp-service.js#L72) in *emp-service.js* . It depends on the SF Instance.


  ```js
      const getSeniorityPayload = (userId, years, months, days, totalDays) => {
          return {
              "__metadata": {
                  "uri": `https://<sf-host>:<sf-port>/odata/v2/EmpEmployment(personIdExternal='${userId}',userId='${userId}')`,
                  "type": "SFOData.EmpEmployment"
              },
  ```

11. Modify the topic name in *emp-service.js* to include the name of the SFSF system registered.


  ```js
  messaging.on(
      "sap/successfactors/SFPART057671/isc/contractchange",
      ...
  )
  ```

12. Change the [redirect URL](https://github.com/SAP-samples/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority/blob/main/xs-security.json#L9) in *xs-security.json*, based on your BAS URL.

  ```json
  {
    "xsappname": "seniority-calc",
    "tenant-mode": "dedicated",
    "scopes": [],
    "attributes": [],
    "role-templates": [],
    "oauth2-configuration": {
      "redirect-uris": [
      "https://*.<region>.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/"
    ]
  }
  }
  ```
