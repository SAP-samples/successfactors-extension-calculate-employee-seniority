Build the Multi-Target Application Archive (MTA Archive) by executing the following command in the root directory of your project in the terminal:

    ```
    mbt build
    ```

4. Deploy the application to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime by executing the following command in the root directory of your project in the terminal:

    ```
    cf deploy mta_archives/seniority-calc_1.0.0.mtar
    ```

    This will trigger the deployment to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime including the creation of the necessary service instances and service bindings to the corresponding apps.

## Redeployment
If you want to redeploy without undeploying the running CAP Application, you need to change a few services in the ```mta.yaml``` from ```managed-service``` to ```existing-service```. For this, adjust the marked lines highlighted [here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority/blob/main/mta.yaml#L49-L50) and [here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/successfactors-extension-calculate-employee-seniority/blob/main/mta.yaml#L61-L62) that it looks like the following:

```yaml
  - name: seniority-calc-em
    #type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
    type: org.cloudfoundry.existing-service
    
    ...

  - name: seniority-calc-sfsf-service
    #type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
    type: org.cloudfoundry.existing-service
```
